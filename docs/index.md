## My Overview

Hi everyone! My name is __Kittitas Kasetsin__, but you can call me __Oak__. I'm a master's student in __Information Management__ with a solid background in cybersecurity. I've earned the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and completed Cybersecurity 101 on TryHackMe.

I have strong analytical skills and hands-on experience in both traditional and online marketing projects. I'm excited to apply these skills in cybersecurity or related fields!
